</blockquote>
<p>Welcome to the <em>Applications in a cloud native world</em> book. This book
will try to outline best practices when developing containerized and
cloud native services.</p>
<p>In order to lay out the foundations we will focus on, we first need to
consider how services have historically been managed.</p>
<p>Let's then jump straight to the <a href="basics.html">Basics</a>.</p>
<h1><a class="header" href="#basics" id="basics">Basics</a></h1>
<h2><a class="header" href="#services" id="services">Services</a></h2>
<p>A <em>service</em> as described by the <a href="https://dictionary.cambridge.org/dictionary/english/service">Cambridge
Dictionary</a>,
by taking one of its meanings:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>service</em>: a system or organization that provides something
important that the public needs.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This meaning is also very accurate for the computing world. Moreover, a
service will not necessarily only be consumed by <em>people</em>, but could
also be consumed by other <em>systems</em>.</p>
<h2><a class="header" href="#servers" id="servers">Servers</a></h2>
<p>A <em>server</em>, as described by the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Server_(computing)">Wikipedia</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>A <em>server</em> is a computer program or a device that provides
functionality for other programs or devices, called &quot;clients&quot;.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It goes further, and also expand to reach a <em>service</em> definition:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Servers can provide various functionalities, often called &quot;services&quot;, such
as sharing data or resources among multiple clients, or performing
computation for a client.</p>
</blockquote>
<h2><a class="header" href="#processes" id="processes">Processes</a></h2>
<p>A <em>process</em>, as described by the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Process_(computing)">Wikipedia</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>A <em>process</em> is the instance of a computer program that is being
executed by one or many threads. It contains the program code and
its activity.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This definition is very tied to what we know about Operating Systems,
by referring to the <code>thread</code> term, but you get the idea.</p>
<h2><a class="header" href="#application" id="application">Application</a></h2>
<p>An <em>application</em>, again, as described by the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Application_software">Wikipedia</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Application software</em> [...] is a program or group of programs
designed for end users.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>And <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/System_software"><em>system software</em></a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>System software</em> is software designed to provide a platform for
other software.</p>
</blockquote>
<h1><a class="header" href="#common-ground" id="common-ground">Common ground</a></h1>
<p>As developers, we create <em>programs</em>; they can be either <em>application
software</em> or <em>system software</em>. These programs serve a purpose,
whether it is for end users directly, or for other <em>systems</em> to consume.</p>
<p><em>Application software</em> usually is meant to be consumed directly
by end users, and so, interaction with the system will be UX driven,
no matter what kind of UX (e.g. terminal, graphical...)</p>
<p><em>System software</em>, however, is going to be consumed by other software,
and as such, this creates friction on both systems. We can ask ourselves
some questions at this point:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>How can both evolve and still make sure that they are complying with the
contract they signed?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>What happens to one service if the other is not responsive, and the
former depends on the latter?</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>We will explore this and other complexities throughout this book.</p>
<h1><a class="header" href="#monolith" id="monolith">Monolith</a></h1>
<p>Enter the <em>monolith</em>. Let's have some fun by reading <a href="https://dictionary.cambridge.org/dictionary/english/service">one of the
Cambridge's dictionary definitions</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>monolith</em>: a large block of stone standing by itself that was put up by people in ancient times.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>First things first: a monolith does not intrinsically signal a bad
design. As we will learn throughout the book, a monolith could be a
perfectly sane solution for many projects and teams. Moreover, it can
even be the best solution given a certain set of constraints.</p>
<p>Let's get to a more focused definition of a <em>monolithic application</em>
as defined by the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monolithic_application">Wikipedia</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>a <em>monolithic application</em> describes a single-tiered software
application in which the user interface and data access code are
combined into a single program from a single platform.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>However, when transposing this definition to client-side
architectures, we could argue that the fact that the backend is a
single-tiered application is in itself a <em>monolith</em>, even if the user
interface is not strictly provided by the backend.</p>
<h1><a class="header" href="#traits" id="traits">Traits</a></h1>
<p>A <em>monolithic application</em> has a number of traits:</p>
<ul>
<li>Contains the whole or a big amount of business logic</li>
<li>Accesses persistency services
<ul>
<li>Databases</li>
<li>Caches</li>
<li>Assets</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>In general terms, a <em>monolith</em> could be internally structured in a
number of modules, which encapsulates code and data that implement a particular
functionality.</p>
<p>For the purpose of further analysis, let's assume that a <em>monolith</em>
has all the business logic and data access logic combined in one. This
doesn't mean that the <em>monolithic application</em> includes the
persistency services, but that it merely consumes them.</p>
<h1><a class="header" href="#scalability" id="scalability">Scalability</a></h1>
<h2><a class="header" href="#vertical-scaling" id="vertical-scaling">Vertical scaling</a></h2>
<p><em>Vertical scaling</em> refers to the strategy of increasing the resources to a
given machine that is running one or more servers, in order to improve
their scalability.</p>
<p>Vertical scaling has the limit of what the machine can cope with.</p>
<h2><a class="header" href="#horizontal-scaling" id="horizontal-scaling">Horizontal scaling</a></h2>
<p>In contrast, <em>horizontal scaling</em> means increasing the number of
instances of a given server. This increase of instances can be done in
different ways, e.g:</p>
<ul>
<li>Configuring a server to increase the number of threads
<ul>
<li>The application needs to be thread safe</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Increasing the number of processes running a server
<ul>
<li>Might improve throughput under certain conditions, but limits of
the machine running this server apply</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Creating more instances of this server on different machines</li>
</ul>
<p>When we refer to horizontal scaling we are usually referring to the
strategy of creating more instances of this server on different
machines.</p>
<p>Horizontal scaling of traditional monolithic applications have a
number of challenges:</p>
<ul>
<li>Deployment of a new instance of the server</li>
<li>Manage the lifecycle of a number of instances of the server in
different machines
<ul>
<li>Monitoring
<ul>
<li>Operational</li>
<li>Rollouts</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Application rollout rollbacks</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Impact on shared services, since they have now several consumers
<ul>
<li>Databases</li>
<li>Key value stores</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Instance specific knowledge
<ul>
<li>Disk caches</li>
<li>Assets</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Some of the challenges previously outlined might or might not apply,
depending on the design of the application.</p>
<h1><a class="header" href="#boundaries" id="boundaries">Boundaries</a></h1>
<p>Boundaries in monolithic applications have been extensively discussed in many
texts. In general, we can observe a vertical alignment in these systems:</p>

</table>
</center>
<p>Usually, one can observe a modular approach in order to achieve the
implementation detail isolation, where every module will only export
interfaces, meant to be consumed by other modules of the same
system. This is what the contract would be in this case.</p>
<p>A monolithic application can be broken down in different modules, that
can reside inside of the same binary, or in shared libraries. A
monolithic application can also consume third party shared libraries
by being linked against them. This conforms a pattern on boundary
separation and code reusability.</p>
<p>API and ABI stability in this context is what matters the most for
other modules that are consuming a certain module from third party
libraries. There are many examples of this, but some would be the Qt
Framework, Glib or Gtk.</p>
<h1><a class="header" href="#deployment" id="deployment">Deployment</a></h1>
<p>Once that we have created an application we want it to be consumed by
end users or other systems. We will explore what have been the
deployment options throughout time, both in terms of <em>infrastructure</em>,
and in the <em>techniques</em> used to perform those deployments.</p>
<h1><a class="header" href="#infrastructure" id="infrastructure">Infrastructure</a></h1>
<p>Our application needs to be running somewhere, so end users and other
systems can consume it. Infrastructure is this somewhere.</p>
<p>Let's go through the different options that we have to deploy our application.</p>
<h1><a class="header" href="#metal" id="metal">Metal</a></h1>
<p>Deploying on the metal is the strategy of deploying an application
directly on top of the operating system that is running on a given
physical machine.</p>
<p>Assuming we have a physical server with an operating system running,
performing the deployment on this environment means running a number
of steps in order for the operating system to spawn a new process that
runs our server.</p>
<center>
<p><img src="monolith/deployment/infrastructure/metal_0.generated.svg" alt="" /></p>
</center>
<h1><a class="header" href="#virtualization" id="virtualization">Virtualization</a></h1>
<p>A virtualized environment abstracts the concept of a physical machine,
running on top of a physical (or virtual) machine.</p>
<p>According to the
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virtualization">Wikipedia</a>,
<em>virtualization</em> is described as:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>virtualization</em>: refers to the act of creating a virtual (rather than
actual) version of something, including virtual computer hardware
platforms, storage devices, and computer network resources.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>When it comes to the deployment of applications, the strategy followed
for <em>metal</em> deployments can also apply on virtualized environments,
but other kind of deployments arised as well: start a machine from a
given template (or snapshot), including the application, or a mixed
approach in which certain components and pre-requisites come with the
template or snapshot, and some automation is used to deploy the
desired version of the application.</p>
<p>Since booting virtual machines is to all effects booting a machine
with a fully fledged operating system the startup time is still in the
orders of metal deployments.</p>
<center>
<p><img src="monolith/deployment/infrastructure/virtualization_0.generated.svg" alt="" /></p>
</center>
<p>Or, virtualized infrastructure can also virtualize other machines,
where we can run our application onto. This is referred as <em>nested virtualization</em>:</p>
<center>
<p><img src="monolith/deployment/infrastructure/virtualization_1.generated.svg" alt="" /></p>
</center>
<h1><a class="header" href="#containerization" id="containerization">Containerization</a></h1>
<p><em>Containerization</em> or OS-level virtualization, according to the
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OS-level_virtualization">Wikipedia</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>OS-level virtualization refers to an operating system paradigm in
which the kernel allows the existence of multiple isolated user
space instances.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>And it continues:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Such instances [...] may look like real computers from the point of
view of programs running in them. A computer program running on an
ordinary operating system can see all resources (connected devices,
files and folders, network shares, CPU power, quantifiable hardware
capabilities) of that computer. However, programs running inside of
a container can only see the container's contents and devices
assigned to the container.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In general, this is where Docker (formerly dotCloud) found a developer
focused niche. The UX Docker introduced allowed developers to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Define container images in a reproducible and in a very easy way</li>
<li>Distribute these container images in a so-called registry</li>
<li>Let developers run containers, based on container images:
<ul>
<li>Previously distributed to a shared registry</li>
<li>Locally built</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>As a result of this, it was much easier to reduce the friction and the
dependency between the application and the system it was running on,
because as with happens with virtual machine images, the container
image includes all operating system components, except for the kernel.</p>
<p>Still, the friction was not completely removed. Many containerized
applications expect environment variables, or certain volume mounting
to be set up, else they won't work as expected.</p>
<p>In any case, containerization and specially the UX dotCloud introduced
helped to make reproducible builds and environments easier with a greatly
reduced friction surface.</p>
<center>
<p><img src="monolith/deployment/infrastructure/containerization_0.generated.svg" alt="" /></p>
</center>
<p>Our containers can also run on top of virtualized machines:</p>
<center>
<p><img src="monolith/deployment/infrastructure/containerization_1.generated.svg" alt="" /></p>
</center>
<h1><a class="header" href="#techniques" id="techniques">Techniques</a></h1>
<p>Deployment techniques vary, but in general we can categorize them in
<em>manual</em> or <em>automated</em>.</p>
<p>A <em>manual</em> deployment is triggered by a human, at any moment in time,
whereas an <em>automated</em> deployment is triggered by a CI/CD component,
such as Jenkins, or Gitlab.</p>
<h1><a class="header" href="#manual" id="manual">Manual</a></h1>
<p>A deployment could mean &quot;upload through FTP&quot; the new version of the
website. It could also mean, &quot;perform a git pull&quot; on the production
server, or some other similar way of deploying a new version of our
application.</p>
<p>Needless to say this was tricky, for several reasons:</p>
<ul>
<li>How does the system behave when in the middle of a deployment?
<ul>
<li>Can a request fail because it hit a codepath when the latest
version of the application wasn't fully deployed?</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>If a certain logical change requires a database migration, or
persistency migration
<ul>
<li>How is it performed?</li>
<li>Is it safe to re run this migration, if run by mistake?</li>
<li>Does it require service downtime until the migration is done?</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>How to check whether the newly deployed version of the application
is performing normally?
<ul>
<li>What will signal us if the deployment is failing?</li>
<li>Will we notice before all our users notice?</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>If proven problematic, how to rollback the deployment?
<ul>
<li>If database migration, or persistency migration was required, how
to rollback this as well?</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>How fast can we react upon these events, without committing more
mistakes along the way?</li>
</ul>
<p>Tools like <a href="https://capistranorb.com/">Capistrano</a> have emerged in
order to perform a set of commands on different machines.</p>
<h1><a class="header" href="#automated" id="automated">Automated</a></h1>
<p>The automated deployment strategy leverages the so called Continuous
Integration and Continuous Delivery methodologies.</p>
<p>This strategy might involve a tool like Jenkins to run all the
required tests to ensure that a new version of the application passes
all required tests, and then, deploy it to the given infrastructure in
a semi-manual (requiring manual confirmation) or completely automatic fashion.</p>
<h1><a class="header" href="#targets" id="targets">Targets</a></h1>
<p>A deployment target can be understood as a machine, or a set of
machines where the application is going to be deployed.</p>
<p>Ultimately, this machine needs to have some component listening for
incoming requests. Generally, a web server is exposed, that will in
turn talk to our application internally, e.g. using a UNIX socket.</p>
<p>However, it's also common to see <em>Application servers</em> (like Zend) or
even <em>Servlet containers</em> (like Tomcat), that allow you to deploy your
application on a fully fledged web server.</p>
<h1><a class="header" href="#service-oriented-architecture" id="service-oriented-architecture">Service Oriented Architecture</a></h1>
<p>According to
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Service-oriented_architecture">Wikipedia</a>,
<em>Service Oriented Architecture</em>, or <em>SOA</em> definition is:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Service-oriented architecture</em> (SOA) is a style of software design
where services are provided to the other components by application
components, through a communication protocol over a network.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>And so, the core of a <em>SOA</em> is the loose coupling of the different
services that conform a given system. According to the <a href="http://www.soa-manifesto.org/">SOA manifesto</a>,
we can point some traits of Service Oriented Architectures:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Business value</strong> over technical strategy</li>
<li><strong>Strategic goals</strong> over project-specific benefits</li>
<li><strong>Intrinsic interoperability</strong> over custom integration</li>
<li><strong>Shared services</strong> over specific-purpose implementations</li>
<li><strong>Flexibility</strong> over optimization</li>
<li><strong>Evolutionary refinement</strong> over pursuit of initial perfection</li>
</ul>
<p>This is a different approach as opposed to internally splitting our
application in modules to define boundaries. With a <em>SOA</em>, we will
have a set of services that can talk to each other over the network,
and so their API will be some form of HTTP or RPC API.</p>
<h1><a class="header" href="#microservice" id="microservice">Microservice</a></h1>
<p>Let's write what <em>microservices</em> means according to the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microservices">Wikipedia</a>,
once again:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Microservices are a software development technique [...] that arranges
an application as a collection of loosely coupled services. In a
microservices architecture, services are fine-grained and the
protocols are lightweight.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Let's take a step back and introduce the notion of <em>component</em>, on
<a href="https://martinfowler.com/articles/microservices.html">Martin Fowler</a>'s
words:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Our definition is that a <em>component</em> is a unit of software that is
independently replaceable and upgradeable.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>And he continues:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Microservice architectures will use libraries, but their primary way
of componentizing their own software is by breaking down into
services. We define libraries as components that are linked into a
program and called using in-memory function calls, while services
are out-of-process components who communicate with a mechanism such
as a web service request, or remote procedure call.</p>
<p>One main reason for using services as components (rather than
libraries) is that services are independently deployable.</p>
<p>[...]</p>
</blockquote>
<h1><a class="header" href="#traits-1" id="traits-1">Traits</a></h1>
<p>While there is no &quot;official&quot; definition of a microservice, we can
settle upon certain characteristics, based on what was described in
the previous section:</p>
<ul>
<li>It has its own lifecycle</li>
<li>Consumed over a well defined API</li>
<li>It can be independently scaled as required</li>
<li>Simple enough to be easily understood</li>
<li>Has its isolated and own persistence, if any; it will never access other
microservice persistence</li>
<li>Communicates with other services using their exposed API's in order
to cross boundaries</li>
</ul>
<p>As a result of this, and given that every component (service) in the
system exposes its functionality through a well defined (and hopefully
documented) API, then, every microservice:</p>
<ul>
<li>Can be implemented in the most appropriate language and framework
for the work</li>
<li>Can have its own internal rules; e.g. one core microservice might be
formally verified in isolation</li>
<li>Can evolve at its own pace, as long as the exposed API's honor the
contract that its consumers expect</li>
</ul>
<h1><a class="header" href="#scalability-1" id="scalability-1">Scalability</a></h1>
<h2><a class="header" href="#vertical-scaling-1" id="vertical-scaling-1">Vertical scaling</a></h2>
<p>Vertical scaling doesn't have any meaningul differences from the
description provided in the <a href="microservice/./../monolith/scalability.html#vertical-scaling">Monolith section</a>.</p>
<h2><a class="header" href="#horizontal-scaling-1" id="horizontal-scaling-1">Horizontal scaling</a></h2>
<p>Horizontally scaling microservices should be an easy operation to
perform, potentially automated by an external orchestrator, such as
Kubernetes.</p>
<p>One of the driving principles for microservices apart from loosely
coupled services is to be able to adapt and react to change faster,
horizontally scaling a given service in a fast way is crucial for our
microservice architecture to be flexible so it can properly absorb
traffic spikes.</p>
<h1><a class="header" href="#boundaries-1" id="boundaries-1">Boundaries</a></h1>
<p>Boundaries in microservices, as <a href="https://martinfowler.com/articles/microservices.html">Martin
Fowler</a>
describes, are organized around business capabilities:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The microservice approach to division is different, splitting up
into services organized around business capability.</p>
<p>Such services take a broad-stack implementation of software for that
business area, including user-interface, persistant storage, and any
external collaborations. Consequently the teams are
cross-functional, including the full range of skills required for
the development: user-experience, database, and project management.</p>

</center>
<p>Given a small set of microservices, everyone on the team managing
those microservices is closer to the whole functionality a service
provides, and become a cross functional team; because they are able to
understand the whole service from end to end.</p>
<p>And ultimately, how both look, when put side by side:</p>

</center>
<p>On the previous diagram is clear how in general terms, a monolith uses
a single database, whereas a set of microservices use their own
storage, reponsibility of different teams, and how a microservice can
at any moment in time be formed by one or more instances, depending on
the load, and on the decisions taken by the administrators and/or the
orchestrator.</p>
<h1><a class="header" href="#deployment-1" id="deployment-1">Deployment</a></h1>
<p>Deployment strategies for microservices can be similar to deploying
monoliths, <a href="microservice/./../monolith/deployment.html">described in a previous section</a>.</p>
<p>However, when managing a constellation of microservices things get
trickier, and this is where an orchestrator comes handy.</p>
<p>In some instances, companies have used their own tooling to deploy and
orchestrate microservice deployment, <a href="https://thenewstack.io/how-weatherbug-uses-microservices-without-containers/">even without
containers</a>.</p>
<p>It has also been typical to see using containers, but in a raw way,
with some <em>Infrastucture as Code</em> (IAC) or <em>Configuration as Code</em>
(CAC) tooling like <em>Ansible</em>, <em>Chef</em> or <em>Puppet</em> handling the <code>docker</code>
CLI directly for managing the microservices lifecycle.</p>
<p>Whatever floats your boat, there is no silver bullet here, but
replicating this tooling again and again for different applications is
costly and error-prone. Orchestrators can greatly help in making this
user experience uniform across different environments and
infrastructure; also, and as we'll discover later they can greatly
respond to external change, trying to ensure that our constraints are
always met, when possible.</p>
<p>This was the spirit in which <em>Kubernetes</em> was conceived, and this is
why for the remaining on this book we will deploy our microservices on
top of an orchestrator. <em>Kubernetes</em> in our case.</p>
<h1><a class="header" href="#cloud-native" id="cloud-native">Cloud Native</a></h1>
<p><a href="https://github.com/cncf/toc/blob/e58a97f253569ee1d79d656baafc685eaceb8786/DEFINITION.md">Cloud Native Computing Foundation (CNCF) Technical
Oversight Commitee (TOC)</a>'s
<em>Cloud Native</em> definition is:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Cloud native</em> technologies empower organizations to build and run
scalable applications in modern, dynamic environments such as
public, private, and hybrid clouds. Containers, service meshes,
microservices, immutable infrastructure, and declarative APIs
exemplify this approach.</p>
<p>These techniques enable loosely coupled systems that are resilient,
manageable, and observable. Combined with robust automation, they
allow engineers to make high-impact changes frequently and
predictably with minimal toil.</p>
<p>[...]</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Let's remind what traits are inherited from <em>microservices</em>:</p>
<ul>
<li>It has its own lifecycle</li>
<li>Consumed over a well defined API</li>
<li>It can be independently scaled as required</li>
<li>Simple enough to be easily understood</li>
<li>Has its isolated and own persistence, if any; it will never access other
microservice persistence</li>
<li>Communicates with other services using their exposed API's in order
to cross boundaries</li>
</ul>
<p>and, some of the consequences:</p>
<ul>
<li>Can be implemented in the most appropriate language and framework
for the work</li>
<li>Can have its own internal rules; e.g. one core microservice might be
formally verified in isolation</li>
<li>Can evolve at its own pace, as long as the exposed API's honor the
contract that its consumers expect</li>
</ul>
<p>So, aside from this traits inherited from the fact that a Cloud Native
application is implemented as a microservice, what are the unique
traits of Cloud Native applications that not all microservices meet?
Let's go through some:</p>
<ul>
<li>Container packaged
<ul>
<li>While this might seem an implementation detail, a Cloud Native
application comes in the form of a container with all required
dependencies for that specific microservice to work correctly.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Dynamically managed
<ul>
<li>Cloud Native applications lifecycle are managed by some external
orchestrator that is able to schedule, scale, monitor and control
the execution of the Cloud Native application.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Failure resiliency
<ul>
<li>Cloud Native applications are built with failure in mind; every
service that they access to can fail at any time, and it should
not result in permanent failure.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Metrics
<ul>
<li>Cloud Native applications expose metrics, so an external
orchestrator is able to take decisions based on load, like scaling
the service in an automated way.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Health checks
<ul>
<li>Liveness probes
<ul>
<li>Cloud Native applications expose health check endpoints, so an
external orchestrator is able to restart the service if it's not
running as expected.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Readiness or startup probes
<ul>
<li>Cloud Native applications expose readiness check endpoints, so an
external orchestrator is able to know when to route requests to a
recently started instance, only when it's ready to process them.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Logging
<ul>
<li>Cloud Native applications usually log into <code>stdout</code> and <code>stderr</code>
streams. Usually, all logs from all applications will be
aggregated into a unified logging layer. This allows us to improve
the observability upon a set of microservices at any given time.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Tracing
<ul>
<li>Cloud Native applications might include tracing
instrumentation. The concept of <em>spans</em> allows us to understand
what happened across a distributed set of services that spawned
a tree of requests from the initial request.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Scalable
<ul>
<li>Cloud Native applications can be scaled in and scaled out as
required, based on current and expected demand.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Ephemeral
<ul>
<li>A Cloud Native application instance has present that is ephemeral,
and so, it can be instantiated at any time, or destroyed at any
time by an external orchestrator.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h1><a class="header" href="#service-communication" id="service-communication">Service communication</a></h1>
<p>When writing a new service, or when consuming other services, there
are some questions that require an answer:</p>
<ul>
<li>Is this service meant to be consumed by external parties?</li>
<li>How will this service be consumed?</li>
<li>How do requests get authenticated?</li>
<li>How do requests get authorized?</li>
<li>What is the Service Level Agreement (SLA) of this service?
<ul>
<li>Even if internal, SLA might apply across services and teams</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>There are different types of services in a Service Oriented
Architecture: <em>internal</em> and <em>external</em>.</p>
<h2><a class="header" href="#internal-services" id="internal-services">Internal services</a></h2>
<p>Internal services implement a certain business capability, or a part
of it. They are meant to be consumed by other services within the
system.</p>
<h2><a class="header" href="#external-services" id="external-services">External services</a></h2>
<p>External services are meant to be consumed by end users. An example of
these services, are for example public API's used by third parties to
integrate some functionality from our product into their platform.</p>
<h2><a class="header" href="#service-intra-communication" id="service-intra-communication">Service intra communication</a></h2>
<p>Internal services can communicate with one another. External services
can communicate with internal services, but internal services should
not communicate with external services of the same system.</p>
<p>Any of them can communicate with external systems if desired.</p>
<h1><a class="header" href="#protocols" id="protocols">Protocols</a></h1>
<p>A service can be exposed in a number of ways in order to be
consumed. Let's name a few ways:</p>
<table><thead><tr><th>Protocol</th><th>Best suited for</th><th>Description</th></tr></thead><tbody>
<tr><td>HTTP</td><td>External</td><td>An HTTP API that exposes endpoints for interacting with the service</td></tr>
<tr><td>GraphQL</td><td>External</td><td>Query language that allows for fine grained retrieval of data</td></tr>
<tr><td>Remote Procedure Calls</td><td>Internal</td><td>RPC's are a lightweight way of exposing service endpoints</td></tr>
</tbody></table>
<h2><a class="header" href="#http" id="http">HTTP</a></h2>
<p>An HTTP API could be RESTful or not. It exposes a number of API
endpoints that can be consumed with HTTP verbs, usually: <code>GET</code>, <code>HEAD</code>,
<code>POST</code>, <code>PUT</code>, <code>PATCH</code> and others.</p>
<p>Data on HTTP requests, whether sent or received by a client require
some kind of type negotiation, in which the client encodes the request
using some kind of serializing (e.g. XML, JSON...), and annotates the
request to be sent to the server; along with an expected type in
which the results should come back.</p>
<p>Different HTTP API's will behave different, and each implementation
might have specialties that require attention: e.g. rate limits
reported on response headers, sessions, or token based authentication
(like <a href="https://jwt.io/">JWT</a>).</p>
<h2><a class="header" href="#graphql" id="graphql">GraphQL</a></h2>
<p><a href="https://graphql.org/">GraphQL</a> is usually served over HTTP, however,
its approach is slightly different to a resource-based
service. GraphQL exposes a single endpoint where it's possible to
query and mutate resources.</p>
<p>GraphQL contains a representation of all the objects it's able to
manage, and thus, it exposes this single endpoint, where clients can
cherry-pick what exact parts of the resources they want back from the
server.</p>
<h2><a class="header" href="#remote-procedure-calls" id="remote-procedure-calls">Remote Procedure Calls</a></h2>
<p>Remote Procedure Calls (RPC's) are not a new idea. SOAP or XML-RPC are
hardly something new.</p>
<p>However, Remote Procedure Calls in a Cloud Native world are usually
referred by frameworks like <a href="https://grpc.io/">gRPC</a>, or
<a href="https://capnproto.org/">Cap'n Proto</a>.</p>
<p>gRPC is typically used along with <a href="https://developers.google.com/protocol-buffers">protocol
buffers</a> as the
serializing/deserializing layer.</p>
<p>They allow us to perform very lightweight calls on other services, and
use HTTP/2 under the covers, so they rely on long lived connections
and on request/response multiplexing. This behavior requires
awareness, because load balancing requests is not as trivial as it is
with HTTP/1.1 requests, and usually require some <a href="https://grpc.io/blog/loadbalancing/">client-side explicit
balancing</a>.</p>
<p>In gRPC, a definition is written for a given service, along with the
procedures and types that are exposed and can be consumed, and it is
able to create a stub of both the server and client for any of the
supported languages.</p>
<h1><a class="header" href="#traffic" id="traffic">Traffic</a></h1>
<p>There are different kinds of traffic that we'll refer to later on
throughout this book.</p>
<h3><a class="header" href="#inbound-or-ingress" id="inbound-or-ingress">Inbound (or ingress)</a></h3>
<p>Inbound traffic is the traffic that comes from outside to the cluster,
towards a service running inside it. This is typically an end-user,
or an external system accessing our external API's.</p>
<h3><a class="header" href="#internal" id="internal">Internal</a></h3>
<p>Internal traffic is traffic that is generated inside the cluster, and
whose destination is another service within the cluster. This is
typically a service to service request.</p>
<h3><a class="header" href="#outbound-or-egress" id="outbound-or-egress">Outbound (or egress)</a></h3>
<p>Outbound traffic is traffic originated inside the cluster, whose
destination is somewhere outside the cluster, can be some service of
our infrastructure running outside of the cluster, or a third party
API that we are integrated with.</p>
<h1><a class="header" href="#kubernetes" id="kubernetes">Kubernetes</a></h1>
<p>Based on the <a href="https://kubernetes.io">official Kubernetes website</a>
definition:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Kubernetes (K8s) is an open-source system for automating deployment,
scaling, and management of containerized applications.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>However, I don't think this description honors what Kubernetes really
does best: <strong>reconcile resources</strong>.</p>
<p>Funnily enough, the fact that Kubernetes is able to deploy and manage
conterinerized applications is primarily because of how the
<strong>reconciliation</strong> of resources happen.</p>
<h2><a class="header" href="#application-and-environment" id="application-and-environment">Application and environment</a></h2>
<p>Usually, when we had to deploy an application we had constant friction
between the application developers and the operations teams -- the
ones that will ultimately be putting the application into production
and maintain its day-to-day operation.</p>
<p>Let's take a step back and see what each step on this story brought
us.</p>
<h3><a class="header" href="#containerization-1" id="containerization-1">Containerization</a></h3>
<p>By being able to easily create a &quot;snapshot&quot; of our application and all
its dependencies, we were able to greatly reduce the friction between
our application and the system it's running on. As developers, we now
have much greater control on the environment our application is
running on.</p>
<p>Of course, this does not mean that we are the sole responsibles of
this, but now we have more <strong>certainty</strong> of what is the environment
our application runs on.</p>
<p>Still, something is missing: how our application is exposed to the
world. There is still a gap here: we provide the snapshot of our
application, but how it's exposed and operated is not up to us.</p>
<h3><a class="header" href="#infrastructure-as-config" id="infrastructure-as-config">Infrastructure as config</a></h3>
<p>Kubernetes is usually referred to as <em>Infrastructure as code</em>, but in
this sense I prefer to call it <em>Infrastructure as config</em>. Now, with
Kubernetes, we have the ability to track the way our application is
deployed and managed:</p>
<ul>
<li>What versions of every component of our applications are bundled
together?</li>
<li>Application secrets</li>
<li>Configuration</li>
<li>Storage used by the application</li>
<li>How the application is exposed</li>
<li>Security
<ul>
<li>What can this application know about the platform?</li>
<li>What permissions have this application when running, at the node level?</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>In general, we can see that while containerizing made our snapshot of
our application broader, Kubernetes also includes how this application
is operated in its snapshot. We now have a complete, reproducible way
of deploying an exact version of our application, including <strong>how</strong> it
is operated.</p>

<h2><a class="header" href="#the-api-server" id="the-api-server">The API Server</a></h2>
<p>Let's start with a very simple overview, and build on top of that:</p>
<center>
<p><img src="kubernetes/components_0.generated.svg" alt="" /></p>
</center>
<p>As users, we will use some kind of client to contact the API Server,
allowing us to <em>list</em>, <em>get</em>, <em>create</em>, <em>modify</em> or <em>delete</em>
resources.</p>
<p>These resources are stored by the <em>API Server</em> in some kind of
<em>Key Value Store</em>. The ubiquitous <em>Key Value Store</em> used for Kubernetes is
<a href="https://etcd.io"><em>etcd</em></a>. However, and as we'll discover later, any
other backend implementing the <em>etcd</em> gRPC interface would work as
well (this is the idea behind <a href="https://github.com/rancher/kine"><em>Kine</em></a>,
for example).</p>
<p>Now, we are able to create and manipulate resources. The <em>API Server</em>
will be the piece that will perform Authentication, Authorization, and
similar features for us, and will eventually store those resources
into <em>etcd</em>. However, we are missing the <em>reconciliation</em> part yet.</p>
<h2><a class="header" href="#the-controller-manager" id="the-controller-manager">The Controller Manager</a></h2>
<p>For this, there is a component in Kubernetes called the <em>Controller
Manager</em>. The <em>Controller Manager</em> has a number of controllers that
can be opted-in, or opted-out. For the sake of simplicity, let's
assume that we use the default ones.</p>
<p>The <em>Controller Manager</em> is just another client, in that it connects
to the <em>API Server</em> in order to watch and manipulate resources.</p>
<p>Let's draw it.</p>
<center>
<p><img src="kubernetes/components_1.generated.svg" alt="" /></p>
</center>
<p>Let's describe what the <em>Controller Manager</em> is, based on the <a href="https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/command-line-tools-reference/kube-controller-manager/">official
documentation</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>[...] is a daemon that embeds the core control loops shipped with
Kubernetes. In applications of robotics and automation, a control
loop is a non-terminating loop that regulates the state of the
system. In Kubernetes, a controller is a control loop that watches
the shared state of the cluster through the apiserver and makes
changes attempting to move the current state towards the desired
state.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Now, what is the <em>Controller Manager</em> reconciling exactly? We are
going to get a bit ahead of time here, but stay with me. Let me
describe two Kubernetes concepts, in the easiest possible way:</p>
<ul>
<li><em>Pod</em>: is a group of one or more containers.</li>
<li><em>ReplicaSet</em>: set of replica <em>Pods</em>. Guarantees the availability of a
specified number of identical <em>Pods</em>.</li>
</ul>
<p>A <em>ReplicaSet</em> allows us to configure a <em>Pod</em> template inside it,
along with a number of replicas that we want running of that <em>Pod</em>.</p>
<p>As such, we as clients can directly create <em>Pods</em>, or we can create
<em>ReplicaSets</em>.</p>
<p><em>ReplicaSets</em> will be <em>reconciled</em> by the <em>ReplicaSetController</em> (one
of the controllers bundled with the <em>Controller Manager</em>), and it will
in turn create as many <em>Pods</em> as required based on the number of
desired replicas.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Important</strong>: by creating a <em>ReplicaSet</em>, the <em>ReplicaSetController</em>
in the <em>Controller Manager</em> <strong>reconciles</strong> the current state (no <em>Pods</em>
exist for this <em>Replica Set</em>), to a new state (desired number of <em>Pods</em>
exist for this <em>Replica Set</em>), by creating the <em>Pods</em> itself against
the <em>API Server</em>. <strong>However</strong>, <em>ReplicaSets</em> and <em>Pods</em> are just
<strong>resources</strong> sitting on our <em>Key Value Store</em>; nothing is running yet.</p>
</blockquote>
<h2><a class="header" href="#the-kubelet" id="the-kubelet">The Kubelet</a></h2>
<p>The <em>Kubelet</em> is the Kubernetes node agent. It runs on every machine
that is part of our cluster, and is another <em>API Server</em> client.</p>
<p>Let's draw it.</p>
<center>
<p><img src="kubernetes/components_2.generated.svg" alt="" /></p>
</center>
<p>Provided we have two nodes in our infrastructure capable of running
workloads, the diagram would look like this:</p>
<center>
<p><img src="kubernetes/components_3.generated.svg" alt="" /></p>
</center>
<p>The <em>Kubelet</em> will then be yet another client of the <em>API Server</em>,
watching for <em>Pods</em> that are assigned to it, and again, <em>reconcile</em>
the <strong>current</strong> status (what pods are running right now on this machine?),
with the <strong>desired</strong> status (what pods should be running right now on
this machine?).</p>
<p>It will use a Container Runtime (such as Docker, cri-o or containerd),
in order to manage the containers defined in <em>Pods</em> (creating, or
deleting them).</p>
<p>Now, if we created a <em>Replica Set</em>, that resulted in <em>Pods</em> being
created by the <em>ReplicaSetController</em>, how do these <em>Pods</em> get
<strong>scheduled</strong> on any of the nodes, so the <em>Kubelet</em> on that node can
then <strong>reconcile</strong> and create the real workloads?</p>
<h2><a class="header" href="#the-scheduler" id="the-scheduler">The Scheduler</a></h2>
<p>As you can imagine, its job is to <em>schedule</em> workloads. Let's get more
into detail: the <em>Scheduler</em> is watching the <em>API Server</em> for <em>Pods</em>
that are <strong>unscheduled</strong>, and will assign a node for each <em>Pod</em>, based
on specific decision algorithms, also taking into account specific
user-provided preferences for those workloads.</p>
<p>Let's draw it.</p>
<p><img src="kubernetes/components_4.generated.svg" alt="" /></p>
<p>And so, again, the <em>Scheduler</em> is just another <em>API Server</em> client.</p>
<h2><a class="header" href="#the-proxy" id="the-proxy">The Proxy</a></h2>
<p>The Kubernetes Proxy (or <em>kube-proxy</em>) is yet another Kubernetes
component running on all nodes of the cluster. Its main duty is to
install networking rules on the host, so pods can reach internal
service IP addresses.</p>
<p>Let's draw it.</p>
<center>
<p><img src="kubernetes/components_5.generated.svg" alt="" /></p>
</center>
<p>The Kubernetes Proxy usually runs in a containerized fashion, but that
is not relevant for the purpose of this diagrams. Let's draw it with
two nodes again:</p>
<p><img src="kubernetes/components_6.generated.svg" alt="" /></p>
<p>Some CNI providers have enabled the ability to not depend on the
Kubernetes Proxy, such as <a href="https://cilium.io">cilium</a>.</p>

<p>Continuous integration, as defined by
<a href="https://www.thoughtworks.com/continuous-integration">ThoughtWorks</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Continuous Integration (CI) is a development practice that requires
developers to integrate code into a shared repository several times
a day. Each check-in is then verified by an automated build,
allowing teams to detect problems early.</p>
<p>By integrating regularly, you can detect errors quickly, and locate
them more easily.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The idea behind continuous integration is to have better certainties
when it comes to deploying an evolution of an application.</p>
<p>By having this constant feedback with small code iterations, we can
be more certain if:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>A proposed change to the codebase is breaking a certain existing
functionality.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A proposed change to the codebase is not fullfilling a certain new
functionality.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A proposed change to the codebase is not including bug regressions.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A combination of changes to the codebase is breaking existing or new
functionality, when both in isolation looked fine.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A third party change in our dependencies is breaking existing
functionality.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>In general, it's a safety net before we deploy our application, so we
can have a higher level of certainty that based on the different tests
we provided, all of them are reporting success. Of course, there is
always a huge negative space -- functionalities and regressions not
covered by our tests, but anyhow we are in a much better position than
if our negative space was the whole space.</p>
<h1><a class="header" href="#testing" id="testing">Testing</a></h1>
<p>Testing is a fundamental piece of Continuous Integration, let's dive
into what kind of tests we can encounter.</p>
<h1><a class="header" href="#unit-tests" id="unit-tests">Unit tests</a></h1>
<p>Unit tests allow us to test very close to the logic of the
application. These tests primary goal is to ensure that the
implementation of our functions and methods work as expected, and they
usually test corner and regular cases.</p>
<p>These tests should be very fast to execute, and they should be
executed very often.</p>
<p>If we are following <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Test-driven_development">Test Driven Development
(TDD)</a>,
best practices recommend:</p>
<ul>
<li>Write a unit test</li>
<li>Run all tests; confirm the test failure</li>
<li>Implement the code</li>
<li>Run all tests; confirm the test success</li>
<li>Refactor the code</li>
<li>Repeat</li>
</ul>
<h1><a class="header" href="#integration-tests" id="integration-tests">Integration tests</a></h1>
<p>Integration tests are at a higher level than unit tests. On <a href="https://martinfowler.com/bliki/IntegrationTest.html">Martin
Fowler</a>'s words:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Integration tests determine if independently developed units of
software work correctly when they are connected to each other.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Martin advocates for two different level of Integration tests, that
we'll discuss in the following sections: <em>Narrow integration tests</em>
and <em>Broad integration tests</em>.</p>
<h1><a class="header" href="#narrow-integration-tests" id="narrow-integration-tests">Narrow integration tests</a></h1>
<p><em>Narrow integration tests</em>, as described by <a href="https://martinfowler.com/bliki/IntegrationTest.html">Martin
Fowler</a>:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Exercise only that portion of the code in my service that talks to a
separate service</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Uses test doubles of those services, either in process or remote</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Thus consist of many narrowly scoped tests, often no larger in scope
than a unit test (and usually run with the same test framework
that's used for unit tests)</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>By the nature of using test doubles, these tests should be in the
orders of unit tests to set up.</p>
<h1><a class="header" href="#broad-integration-tests" id="broad-integration-tests">Broad integration tests</a></h1>
<p><em>Broad integration tests</em>, as described by <a href="https://martinfowler.com/bliki/IntegrationTest.html">Martin
Fowler</a>:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Require live versions of all services, requiring substantial test
environment and network access</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Exercise code paths through all services, not just code responsible
for interactions</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>While <em>Broad integration tests</em> are still focused on the integration
between two components, they require a fair amount of work to set up,
and is at a higher level of complexity than <em>Narrow integration tests</em>
in terms of setup, because they require that components really talk to
each other, with the real versions of those services.</p>
<p>Besides that, the scope is bigger than with <em>Narrow integration
tests</em>, because <em>Broad integration tests</em> do not focus on the parts of
the code that interacts with other services, but more complete code paths.</p>
<h1><a class="header" href="#functional-tests" id="functional-tests">Functional tests</a></h1>
<p><em>Functional tests</em> are a step further than <em>Narrow integration tests</em>
and <em>Broad integration tests</em>.</p>
<p><em>Functional tests</em> require real services to be set up, as happens with
<em>Broad integration tests</em>, but their focus is on the business
requirements of the application, unlike <em>Broad integration tests</em>,
that are focused on the correct implementation of several code paths
involving several services.</p>
<h1><a class="header" href="#end-to-end-tests" id="end-to-end-tests">End to end tests</a></h1>
<p><em>End to end</em> tests main focus is to replicate the user behavior given
a complete system running of our application.</p>
<p>They usually focus on <em>user stories</em> to ensure that functionalities
expected by our customers or users work as expected, and they cannot
get into any details of the system internally: they only can interact
with the system as a user would do.</p>
<h1><a class="header" href="#acceptance-tests" id="acceptance-tests">Acceptance tests</a></h1>
<p>The main goal of acceptance tests is to ensure that a given system,
with all its components and services running meet whatever constraints
were set. It's a contract.</p>
<p>These tests usually focus on business requirements but their goal is
to determine if an evolution of our application still honors the
contract, and so it can be accepted.</p>
<p>These tests might include very different checks, but to name a few:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>A certain user flow is met as desired.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The system meets given performance thresholds on the whole system or
on certain subsytems.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The system meets certain security requirements.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>These are some examples, but anything from a high perspective can be
added to this contract.</p>
<h1><a class="header" href="#performance-tests" id="performance-tests">Performance tests</a></h1>
<p><em>Performance tests</em> ensure from a technical point of view that certain
services, components or flows in our system have not been degraded by
recent evolutions of the software.</p>
<p>In case that the performance was degraded by a recent change in our
system, they can be used to pin point the change or set of changes
that incurred in this penalty.</p>
<h1><a class="header" href="#smoke-tests" id="smoke-tests">Smoke tests</a></h1>
<h1><a class="header" href="#build-artifacts" id="build-artifacts">Build artifacts</a></h1>
<p><em>Build artifacts</em> are the result of running a pipeline in our Continuous
Integration system.</p>
<p>We can register as many build artifacts as desired, so we can watch
them along with our results in our CI system.</p>
<p>However, when talking about container based microservices, it's very
common to build a container image at the beginning of the pipeline,
and use this artifact to perform a certain set of tests.</p>
<center>
<p><img src="continuous-integration/../mdbook-plantuml-img/8bf39300-3712-475f-a00a-a292c8306b1f.svg" alt="../mdbook-plantuml-img/8bf39300-3712-475f-a00a-a292c8306b1f.svg" /></p>
</center>
<p>Pushing container images to a container registry does not mean
anything about <strong>delivery</strong> though, aside from the fact that those new
container images are sitting on our container image registry.</p>
<h1><a class="header" href="#container-image-registry" id="container-image-registry">Container image registry</a></h1>
<p>Once that all our tests have passed, our <em>Continuous integration</em>
pipeline can push a new version of our container image to our
registry. Ideally, these container images should have a univocally
determined tag that can help us understand what exact version of the
container image is running on all our services.</p>
<p>For example, it's not a good practice to once all our tests have
passed, push a container image with a <code>latest</code> tag to our registry and
use it on our deployment manifests. We will have poor control over
what exact version of the container image is running at a given time.</p>
<p>We can leverage a hosted third party container image repository, such
as the <a href="https://hub.docker.com/">Docker Hub</a>, or
<a href="https://quay.io">quay.io</a> -- along with many others, however, for
greater control, it's better if we own our container image registry
(or even several instances, for example for different environments or
groups within our organization).</p>
<p>Several options exist for in-premises container image registry:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://docs.docker.com/registry/">Docker registry</a></li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/quay/quay">quay</a></li>
</ul>
<p>Ideally, you can even deploy these registries inside your Kubernetes
clusters.</p>
<h1><a class="header" href="#continuous-delivery" id="continuous-delivery">Continuous Delivery</a></h1>
<p><em>Continuous Delivery</em> as described in <a href="https://continuousdelivery.com/">continuousdelivery.com</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Continuous Delivery is the ability to get changes of all
types—including new features, configuration changes, bug fixes and
experiments—into production, or into the hands of users, safely and
quickly in a sustainable way.</p>
<p>Our goal is to make deployments—whether of a large-scale distributed
system, a complex production environment, an embedded system, or an
app—predictable, routine affairs that can be performed on demand.</p>
<p>We achieve all this by ensuring our code is always in a deployable
state, even in the face of teams of thousands of developers making
changes on a daily basis. We thus completely eliminate the
integration, testing and hardening phases that traditionally
followed “dev complete”, as well as code freezes.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>As you can imagine, it is very tied to <em>Continuous Integration</em>, and a
good <em>Continuous Integration</em> implementation greatly empowers
<em>Continuous Delivery</em>.</p>
<p>The idea that we can deliver new iterations of software at a very good
pace and frequently improves the confidence on the system.</p>
<p><em>Continuous Delivery</em> is not strictly tied to <strong>automated
deliveries</strong>, but it can be implemented as such, where no human is
required to press any button in order to deploy a new iteration of our
system.</p>
<h1><a class="header" href="#ci-driven" id="ci-driven">CI driven</a></h1>
<p>As we have discussed previously, we have now two levels of composition
when deploying our application:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>A set of container images, representing all our services, that
ultimately together comprise our application.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The configuration needed to deploy them inside a Kubernetes cluster.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Both are very tied, and while we are now in a much better position,
being able to replicate all our services along with the configuration,
there is still room for failure.</p>
<p>Our development cycle could involve several steps, let's imagine the
following:</p>
<ul>
<li>Build and push a new version of a given service, as a container
image into our container image registry -- for this to happen, all
our tests should have passed.</li>
</ul>
<p>This leaves the open question: who or what updates the deployment
manifests and all the configuration that goes along with it? When is
this done?</p>
<p>We could argue that all changes, both to the service and the
deployment manifests are done together, and so if they passed, it
should be safe to redeploy with the deployment manifests that were
merged.</p>
<p>However, it's not as simple as it looks.</p>
<p>Again, there is friction when it comes to certain deployment objects:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Secrets that should only be in production, never sitting on a
developers machine.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Persistent volumes that access datastores that are only used in
production, and that the <em>Continuous Integration</em> should never have
access to.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Access to third party services that require production secrets and
that we don't want near our <em>Continuous Integration</em> pipeline, not
even pointing to the production endpoints.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>And so, we can see that there is still room for differences between
what our CI pipeline has tested, and what will actually run in
production. Again, room for failure.</p>
<p>Also, when we are submitting a change to our application, provided
that deployment manifests are alongside it, what tag should we place
in the manifest, so our latest version of the service is deployed in
the test pipeline? This can be overcomed with CI specific logic, but
is worth noting.</p>
<p><em>Continuous Integration</em> systems are not meant to deploy and observe
the application after it has been deployed, this is why we need
something else to perform <em>Continuous Delivery</em> in a safer way.</p>
<p>It is a great tool to perform all kinds of tests on the evolution of
our application, and push some artifacts that can later be used to
perform the real delivery of our application.</p>
<h1><a class="header" href="#gitops" id="gitops">GitOps</a></h1>
<p>As we have seen, our <em>Continous Integration</em> pipelines are not the
best place to perform a rollout of our application.</p>
<p><em>GitOps</em> is a term <a href="https://www.weave.works/technologies/gitops/">coined by
WeaveWorks</a>, so let's
see what is their definition:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>GitOps is a way to do Kubernetes cluster management and application
delivery.  It works by using Git as a single source of truth for
declarative infrastructure and applications. With Git at the center
of your delivery pipelines, developers can make pull requests to
accelerate and simplify application deployments and operations tasks
to Kubernetes.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Let's list the principles they name:</p>
<ol>
<li>The entire system described declaratively</li>
<li>The canonical desired system state versioned in Git</li>
<li>Approved changes can be automatically applied to the system</li>
<li>Software agents to ensure correctness and alert on divergence</li>
</ol>
<p>While we are very used to 1-3, 4 is something that sounds new. Let's
see that one more in detail:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Once the state of your system is declared and kept under version
control, software agents can inform you whenever reality doesn’t
match your expectations.  The use of agents also ensures that your
entire system is self-healing. And by self-healing, we don’t just
mean when nodes or pods fail—those are handled by Kubernetes—but in
a broader sense, like in the case of human error.  In this case,
software agents act as the feedback and control loop for your
operations.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Now, this is what feels different as a Continuous Delivery
procedure. Let's replicate the workflow they claim:</p>
<ol>
<li>A pull request for a new feature is pushed to GitHub for review.</li>
<li>The code is reviewed and approved by a colleague. After the code is
revised, and re-approved it is merged to Git.</li>
<li>The Git merge triggers the CI and build pipeline, runs a series of
tests and then eventually builds a new image and deposits to the
new image to a registry.</li>
<li>The Weave Cloud ‘Deployment Automator’ watches the image registry,
notices the image, pulls the new image from the registry and
updates its YAML in the config repo.</li>
<li>The Weave Cloud ‘Deployment Synchronizer’ (installed to the
cluster), detects that the cluster is out of date. It pulls the
changed manifests from the config repo and deploys the new feature
to production.</li>
</ol>
<p>And an obligatory diagram:</p>

<p>It's very clear now that we have now a set of explicit components
<strong>driving</strong> the rollout phase. It is the responsibility of this
component to ensure that the deployment is driven to success, and
alert otherwise.</p>
<p>Solutions like <a href="https://argoproj.github.io/argo-cd/">Argo CD</a> allow
for an implementation of <em>Continuous Delivery</em> pipelines as well.</p>
<h1><a class="header" href="#observability" id="observability">Observability</a></h1>
<p>Moving to microservices have some advantages under certain
circumstances. Different teams within an organization are free to
build and run them, owning them from beginning to end.</p>
<p>Observing a monolith and ensuring that it's working as expected is
relatively easy -- as opposed to a constellation of
microservices. With a monolith we have greater control of what is
happening at any given time on the whole system, while losing
development agility; with microservices now the challenge is how to
understand the whole picture, and how a service can affect others when
it's not behaving as expected.</p>
<p>However, while the microservices themselves have a lower complexity
code-wise when looked at them independently, the challenge is now to
<strong>observe</strong> the whole system, and that all components are working as
expected, being able to detect anomalies as fast as possible. We have
many moving targets.</p>
<p><em>Observability</em> usually refers to the combination of the following
practices:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><em>Monitoring</em>: we need to monitor all microservices, ensuring that
they are running as expected with the resources that they are
supposed to use. A bad deployed service could be restarting under
certain code paths, <em>monitoring</em> allows us to better understand when
is this happening.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>Logging</em>: since we have now a number of microservices, each one
logging on its own, we need to perform <em>logging aggregation</em>, what
allows us to send all logs from all services to a central logging
service, that helps us isolate logs from different services at a
given time window.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>Tracing</em>: now a request on a service can end up spawning a complex
tree of requests between different services. By <em>tracing</em> these
requests we can better understand what requests led to anothers, and
what was the relationship between them.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>Metrics</em>: a microservice can expose metrics, so an external
orchestrator is able to know if it needs to scale in or out a given
microservice based on the demand.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Also, we have to monitor both the infrastructure (the Kubernetes
cluster healthiness), as well as our applications running on top of it.</p>
<h1><a class="header" href="#monitoring" id="monitoring">Monitoring</a></h1>
<p>Monitoring applies both to the infrastructure and the applications
running on top of it.</p>
<p>Usually, we can leverage the same tools to monitor both levels.</p>
<p><a href="https://prometheus.io/">Prometheus</a> and
<a href="https://grafana.com/">Grafana</a> are the ubiquitous solutions to
provide this desired level of monitoring.</p>
<p><em>Prometheus</em> is a time-series database used to store all the
monitoring information for all our cluster components. It ships with a
powerful query language to retrieve information.</p>
<p><em>Grafana</em> is the dashboard that leverages the <em>Prometheus</em> query
language in order to show it in a graphical and more understandable
way. It is highly configurable, so you can organize dashboards at will.</p>
<p>At the infrastructure level, we can find the <a href="https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/debug-application-cluster/monitor-node-health/"><em>Node problem
detector</em></a>,
that runs in form of a <em>DaemonSet</em>, reporting to the <em>Node</em> object in
the API Server node conditions and events.</p>

<h2><a class="header" href="#resource-metrics" id="resource-metrics">Resource metrics</a></h2>
<p>The resource metrics pipeline allows components like the <em>Horizontal
Pod Autoscaler</em> to take decisions on a small set of metrics; these
metrics are collected by an in-memory
<a href="https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/metrics-server">metrics-server</a>. The
<em>Kubelets</em> are the ones providing the information on pod resource
usage, and uses <a href="https://github.com/google/cadvisor"><code>cAdvisor</code></a> to
collect this information.</p>

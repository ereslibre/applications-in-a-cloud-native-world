# Integration tests

Integration tests are at a higher level than unit tests. On [Martin
Fowler](https://martinfowler.com/bliki/IntegrationTest.html)'s words:

> Integration tests determine if independently developed units of
> software work correctly when they are connected to each other.

Martin advocates for two different level of Integration tests, that
we'll discuss in the following sections: *Narrow integration tests*
and *Broad integration tests*.

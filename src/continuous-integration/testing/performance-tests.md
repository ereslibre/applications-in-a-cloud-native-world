# Performance tests

*Performance tests* ensure from a technical point of view that certain
services, components or flows in our system have not been degraded by
recent evolutions of the software.

In case that the performance was degraded by a recent change in our
system, they can be used to pin point the change or set of changes
that incurred in this penalty.

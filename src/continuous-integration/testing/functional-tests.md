# Functional tests

*Functional tests* are a step further than *Narrow integration tests*
and *Broad integration tests*.

*Functional tests* require real services to be set up, as happens with
*Broad integration tests*, but their focus is on the business
requirements of the application, unlike *Broad integration tests*,
that are focused on the correct implementation of several code paths
involving several services.

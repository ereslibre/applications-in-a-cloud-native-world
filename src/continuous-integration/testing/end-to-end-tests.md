# End to end tests

*End to end* tests main focus is to replicate the user behavior given
a complete system running of our application.

They usually focus on *user stories* to ensure that functionalities
expected by our customers or users work as expected, and they cannot
get into any details of the system internally: they only can interact
with the system as a user would do.

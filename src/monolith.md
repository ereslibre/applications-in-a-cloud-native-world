# Monolith

Enter the *monolith*. Let's have some fun by reading [one of the
Cambridge's dictionary definitions](https://dictionary.cambridge.org/dictionary/english/service):

> *monolith*: a large block of stone standing by itself that was put up by people in ancient times.

First things first: a monolith does not intrinsecally signal a bad
design. As we will learn throughout the book, a monolith could be a
perfectly sane solution for many projects and teams. Moreover, it can
even be the best solution given a certain set of constraints.

# Continuous Delivery

*Continuous Delivery* as described in [continuousdelivery.com](https://continuousdelivery.com/):

> Continuous Delivery is the ability to get changes of all
> types—including new features, configuration changes, bug fixes and
> experiments—into production, or into the hands of users, safely and
> quickly in a sustainable way.
>
> Our goal is to make deployments—whether of a large-scale distributed
> system, a complex production environment, an embedded system, or an
> app—predictable, routine affairs that can be performed on demand.
>
> We achieve all this by ensuring our code is always in a deployable
> state, even in the face of teams of thousands of developers making
> changes on a daily basis. We thus completely eliminate the
> integration, testing and hardening phases that traditionally
> followed “dev complete”, as well as code freezes.

As you can imagine, it is very tied to *Continuous Integration*, and a
good *Continuous Integration* implementation greatly empowers
*Continuous Delivery*.

The idea that we can deliver new iterations of software at a very good
pace and frequently improves the confidence on the system.

*Continuous Delivery* is not strictly tied to **automated
deliveries**, but it can be implemented as such, where no human is
required to press any button in order to deploy a new iteration of our
system.

# Microservice

Let's write what *microservices* means according to the [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microservices),
once more:

> Microservices are a software development technique —a variant of the
> service-oriented architecture (SOA) structural style— that arranges
> an application as a collection of loosely coupled services. In a
> microservices architecture, services are fine-grained and the
> protocols are lightweight.

# Scalability

## Vertical scaling

Vertical scaling doesn't have any meaningul differences from the
description provided in the [Monolith section](monolith.md#vertical-scaling).

## Horizontal scaling

Due to the traits we have discussed in the [Cloud Native
section](#cloud-native), horizontally scaling microservices should be
an easy operation to perform, potentially automated by an external
orchestrator, such as Kubernetes.

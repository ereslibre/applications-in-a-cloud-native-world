# Scalability

## Vertical scaling

Vertical scaling doesn't have any meaningul differences from the
description provided in the [Monolith section](/monolith/scalability.md#vertical-scaling).

## Horizontal scaling

Due to the traits we have discussed in the [Cloud Native
section](/microservice/cloud-native.md), horizontally scaling
microservices should be an easy operation to perform, potentially
automated by an external orchestrator, such as Kubernetes.

# Automated

The automated deployment strategy leverages the so called Continuous
Integration and Continuous Delivery methodologies.

This strategy might involve a tool like Jenkins to run all the
required tests to ensure that a new version of the application passes
all required tests, and then, deploy it to the given infrastructure in
a semi-manual (requiring manual confirmation) or completely automatic fashion.
